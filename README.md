# Data-assignment-week9-sql-challenge

## Data modelling and engineering

The six CSV starter code files were inspected to create tables for each respective CSV file.

The type of data was also inspected to ensure the relevant data types were correctly allocated to each column and constraints were put on the data (not null, feasible value lengths etc.) to ensure the data parameters made it less likely for the data to be corrupt or unusable.

Once the six CSV files were inspected, tables were created in SQL.

I then determined what data should be classified as primary and foreign keys to be able to query the data for the Data Analysis step. After trial and error and discussing during my tutor session with Khangwelo. After our discussion I recreated the tables in the correct sequence to ensure the primary and foreign keys would be able to interact with each other.

I identified the 'employee' csv date columns for birth date and hire date had formatting issues. With inconsistent presentation of the data, this resulted in an error when importing the csv data into the SQL employee table. To overcome this code was written in 'employee_filter_code.ipynb' to convert the data to datetime format as it was originally stored as an object. I then exported this data into a new csv file called 'employees_python_final' and imported this csv data into the SQL employee table. This then worked and I could proceed with the challenge.

I uploaded my schema into QuickDBD to visually represent the relationships between the data as shown below.
